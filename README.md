# NMR_to_RTs
Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) measurements can quantify different type of fluid volume distribution in shale in term of T_1 and T_2. However, it is hard to seperate fluids as decision boundaries of different fluids are nonlinear. Daigle (2014) define two new parameters R and T_s. By expressing T_2,T_1 in term of the new parameters, volume distribution F(T_2,T_1) can be mapped to volume distribution G(R,Ts). In the new distribution, decision boundaries become linear. 
     

## How does this works?

The T1T2 distribution is display below.

Convert this distribution to R,Ts distribution.

Calculate the volume in 7 zones.
